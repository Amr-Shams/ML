# Spam Email Classification Pipeline

This project implements a spam email classification pipeline using the Naive Bayes classifier and Random Forest algorithm. The pipeline performs data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
The spam and ham email datasets are downloaded and extracted using the `fetch_spam_data()` function. Individual emails are loaded and parsed using the `load_email()` function. The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`. Preprocessing steps include converting email content to text format, removing headers, replacing URLs and numbers, and performing stemming.

## Feature Extraction
Two custom transformers are used to extract features from the email text:
- `EmailToWordCounterTransformer`: Converts email text to word count dictionaries, tokenizes the text, replaces URLs and numbers, removes punctuation, and performs stemming.
- `WordCounterToVectorTransformer`: Converts the word count dictionaries into sparse feature vectors using a fixed vocabulary size.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Two models, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated using the following steps:
1. Fit the models using `fit()` on the training data.
2. Generate predictions using `predict()` on the testing data.w
3. Print the classification report, which provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

## Further Improvements
Here are some suggestions for further improvements:
- Explore additional preprocessing techniques, such as removing stop words, handling HTML content, or utilizing advanced feature extraction methods like TF-IDF.
- Incorporate cross-validation to obtain more reliable performance estimates.
- Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) to optimize hyperparameters for each model.
- Explore other classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Gradient Boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM, for improved performance.

These points will help you understand the key steps and techniques involved in building a spam email classification pipeline using machine learning algorithms.

Feel free to explore and customize the pipeline to suit your specific requirements and improve the performance of the spam email classification system.
