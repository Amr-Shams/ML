Correlation is a scaled version of covariance. Correlation is dimensionless, while covariance is in units obtained by multiplying the units of the two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. [The form of the definition involves a “product moment”, that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient).

we discovered we have three types of relations 
1. Positive: the correlation in this case will indicate how strong is the relation between the points and we can use the p-value as an indicator to how much we are confident about our new guess of a undiscovered data.  the smaller the p-value the greater we are assure about our guess. 
2. Negative: as in the positive relation we found an additional info. Remember the relation between the p-value and the sample size so the less sample size the larger the p-value the less confidence we have. 
3. No relation 
::: For correlation, a p-value tells us
the probability that randomly drawn dots will result in a
similarly strong relationship, or stronger.
- even though large sample of data is good but even though if the correlation is bad or close to the zero your guess will be bad
  but the more data you have the more confidence you got to guess, as the p-value decreases.  the bad result but still be bad though lol
