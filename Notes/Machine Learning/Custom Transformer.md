1. **Log Transformer**:
    
    - The `log_transformer` is created using the `FunctionTransformer` class and applies the natural logarithm (`np.log`) to a feature.
    - It can be used to transform features with heavy-tailed distributions by replacing them with their logarithm.
    - The `inverse_func` argument is optional and specifies the inverse transformation function (e.g., `np.exp`) if the transformer is used in a `TransformedTargetRegressor`.
2. **RBF Transformer**:
    
    - The `rbf_transformer` is created using the `FunctionTransformer` class and applies the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel (`rbf_kernel`) to a feature.
    - It demonstrates how to compute a Gaussian RBF similarity measure using a custom transformer.
    - The `kw_args` argument is used to pass additional keyword arguments to the `rbf_kernel` function, such as `gamma` and `Y`.
    - The resulting transformed feature represents the similarity between each sample and a fixed point (e.g., "35.").
3. **Custom Transformer for Ratio Calculation**:
    
    - The `ratio_transformer` is created using the `FunctionTransformer` class and computes the ratio between the first and second columns of the input array.
    - It demonstrates how to create a custom transformer that combines features by performing a specific calculation.
4. **Custom Transformer with Training**:
    
    - The `StandardScalerClone` is a custom transformer created as a Python class.
    - It inherits from the `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` classes, which provide additional methods like `get_params()` and `set_params()`.
    - The `StandardScalerClone` performs standardization by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature.
    - The `fit()` method learns the mean and standard deviation from the input data and returns the transformer object itself.
    - The `transform()` method applies the learned transformation to the input data.
    - The `check_array()` and `check_is_fitted()` functions from `sklearn.utils.validation` are used for input validation and checking whether the transformer is fitted.
    - The custom transformer follows Scikit-Learn's API conventions to ensure compatibility with pipelines and other Scikit-Learn components.
5. **Custom Transformer using Other Estimators**:
    
    - The `ClusterSimilarity` is another custom transformer implemented as a Python class.
    - It uses the `KMeans` clustering algorithm from Scikit-Learn in the `fit()` method to identify the main clusters in the training data.
    - The `transform()` method computes the similarity between each sample and the cluster centers using the Gaussian RBF kernel (`rbf_kernel`).
    - The `get_feature_names_out()` method returns the names of the transformed features.
    - The custom transformer demonstrates how to use other estimators within a custom transformer and combine them to perform specific transformations.

By creating custom transformers, you can handle custom transformations, perform cleanup operations, combine features, and even utilize other Scikit-Learn estimators within the transformers. Custom transformers provide flexibility and allow you to define specific data transformations that suit your needs.
