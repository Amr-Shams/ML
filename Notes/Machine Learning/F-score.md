The F-score, also known as the F1-score, is a commonly used evaluation metric that combines precision and recall into a single measure. It provides a balance between precision and recall and is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when both precision and recall are important.

The F-score is calculated using the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

F-score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

The F-score ranges between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 indicating perfect precision and recall, and a value of 0 indicating the worst performance.
