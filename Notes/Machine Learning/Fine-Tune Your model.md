1. **Grid Search**: Manually tuning hyperparameters is tedious and time-consuming. Instead, use Scikit-Learn's `GridSearchCV` class to automate the search for the best hyperparameter combination. Specify the hyperparameters and their values to explore, and it will evaluate all possible combinations using cross-validation.
    
2. **Randomized Search**: When the hyperparameter search space is large, `RandomizedSearchCV` is more efficient. It randomly selects a fixed number of combinations to evaluate, allowing exploration of a broader range of hyperparameter values.
    
3. **HalvingRandomSearchCV** and **HalvingGridSearchCV**: These hyperparameter search classes efficiently utilize computational resources. They use a series of rounds to gradually narrow down the candidates, training models on limited resources initially, and then allocating more resources to the best candidates in subsequent rounds.
    
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining the best-performing models in an ensemble often leads to better overall performance. Ensemble methods, such as random forests, leverage the strengths of individual models to make more accurate predictions. Exploring and experimenting with different ensemble strategies can improve model performance.
