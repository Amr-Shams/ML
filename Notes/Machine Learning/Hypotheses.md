Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical method used to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, and analyzing the sample data to make a decision about whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis assumes that any observed differences or effects in the sample data are due to random chance or sampling variability, while the alternative hypothesis represents the researcher's belief or claim that there is an effect or difference in the population. The decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis is based on the strength of the evidence provided by the data. Hypothesis testing is widely used in various fields, including science, engineering, social sciences, and business, to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence.

1. Hypothesis Testing:

	- Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or conclusions about a population based on sample data.
	- It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, and analyzing the sample data to make a decision.
	- needs three main components
	  1. Data
	  2. Null or primary Hypothesis 
	  3. Alternative Hypothesis
	     depends on the group of the hypothesis. 

2. Null Hypothesis (H0):

	- The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference.
	- It assumes that any observed differences or effects in the sample data are due to random chance or sampling variability.
	- Denoted as H0, it is often the hypothesis that is initially assumed to be true.

3. Reject or Fail to Reject:

	- In hypothesis testing, we analyze the sample data to make a decision about whether to reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it.
	- We make this decision based on the strength of the evidence provided by the data.

4. Alternative Hypothesis (HA or H1):

	- The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.
	- It represents the researcher's belief or claim that there is an effect or difference in the population.
	- Denoted as HA or H1, it is typically what the researcher wants to establish or prove.
