Regularized linear models are variants of linear regression that introduce regularization terms to the cost function. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. In the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, Chapter 4 covers three common types of regularized linear models: Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net.

1. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):
   - Ridge Regression adds an L2 regularization term to the linear regression cost function. The regularization term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weight vector.
   - The regularization term penalizes large weights, which encourages the model to use smaller weights for each feature and helps to prevent overfitting.
   - Ridge Regression can be useful when dealing with multicollinearity (high correlation between features) since it will tend to distribute the weights more evenly among the correlated features.
   - The strength of regularization is controlled by the hyperparameter α (alpha). A higher α value results in more regularization and a simpler model.
   - Ridge Regression cost function: J(θ) = MSE(θ) + αΣθi^2

2. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):
   - Lasso Regression adds an L1 regularization term to the linear regression cost function. The regularization term is proportional to the absolute value of the model's weight vector.
   - The L1 regularization introduces sparsity in the model by driving some of the feature weights to exactly zero. This can lead to feature selection, as some features will be ignored by the model.
   - Lasso Regression is useful when you suspect that only a few features are important, as it can automatically perform feature selection.
   - The strength of regularization is controlled by the hyperparameter α (alpha). A higher α value increases the amount of regularization and leads to a sparser model.
   - Lasso Regression cost function: J(θ) = MSE(θ) + αΣ|θi|

3. Elastic Net:
   - Elastic Net combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms in the linear regression cost function.
   - The model introduces both sparsity and constraint on the model's weights. It offers a balance between Ridge and Lasso regression.
   - Elastic Net is useful when dealing with datasets with many features and strong multicollinearity.
   - The two hyperparameters α (alpha) and ρ (rho) control the strength of regularization and the balance between L1 and L2 regularization, respectively.

The choice between Ridge, Lasso, or Elastic Net regularization depends on the specific problem and the dataset. If you suspect that all features are relevant, Ridge Regression might be a good choice. If you believe that only a few features are important and want a sparse model, Lasso Regression could be more appropriate. Elastic Net can be a good default option when you are unsure about the dataset's characteristics.

It's essential to tune the hyperparameters α and ρ using techniques like cross-validation to find the best regularization for your problem. Regularized linear models can significantly improve the performance and generalization of linear regression, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets and potential overfitting.
