**Linear Regression**: A basic linear regression model that fits a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. It can be trained using LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model module.

**Decision Tree Regressor**: A model that uses a decision tree to predict the target variable based on the features. It can capture nonlinear relationships in the data. You can train a decision tree regressor using DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn.tree module.

**Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees and makes predictions by averaging their outputs. It can reduce overfitting and improve predictive performance. You can use RandomForestRegressor from the sklearn.ensemble module.
