1. Min-Max Scaling (Normalization):
    
    - Method: Rescales attribute values to a range between 0 and 1.
    - Formula: (value - min) / (max - min)
    - Use Case: Use when you need to preserve the original data range and you don't have outliers that could greatly impact the scaling. It is suitable for algorithms that require input features to be within a specific range, such as neural networks.
2. Standardization (Z-score Scaling):
    
    - Method: Standardizes attribute values to have zero mean and unit variance.
    - Formula: (value - mean) / standard deviation
    - Use Case: Use when you want to remove the mean and scale the data to have similar variances. Standardization is less affected by outliers and is commonly used in algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
3. Feature Transformation (e.g., square root, logarithm):
    
    - Method: Transforming the feature values using mathematical functions.
    - Use Case: Use when the original feature distribution has a heavy tail or is skewed. Transformations like taking the square root or logarithm can help make the distribution more symmetrical and reduce the influence of outliers. The choice of transformation depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific algorithm being used.
4. Bucketizing (Equal-sized buckets or percentiles):
    
    - Method: Dividing the feature values into bins or buckets.
    - Use Case: Use when the feature has a heavy-tailed or multimodal distribution. Bucketizing allows you to convert numerical features into categorical features, enabling the model to learn different rules for different ranges or modes of the feature. Equal-sized buckets can create a uniform distribution, while using percentiles can handle heavy-tailed distributions.
5. Radial Basis Function (RBF) Transformation:
    
    - Method: Creating a new feature that measures the similarity between a specific value and the feature using a radial basis function.
    - Use Case: Use when the feature has multiple modes or distinct peaks. The RBF transformation helps capture relationships between the feature and the target variable, allowing the model to learn different patterns for different ranges of the feature values.
